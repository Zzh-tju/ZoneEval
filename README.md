# Why does spatial equilibrium matter?

The detector cannot perform uniformly across the zones.
And the detection performance is correlated with the object distribution.
When the object distribution satisfies the centralized photographerâ€™s bias, the detector will favor more to the central zone, while losing the performance in most areas outside.
