# Why does spatial equilibrium matter?

### The detector cannot perform uniformly across the zones.

The detection performance is correlated with the object distribution.
When the object distribution satisfies the centralized photographerâ€™s bias, the detector will favor more to the central zone, while losing the performance in most areas outside.

This is not good for robust detection application.
